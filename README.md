## Inspiration
From the time we start our you tube channel and build our community we start feeling need of one platform where we can upload and manage all the activities of student easily. Our Soul motivation behind building this website is to help school and colleges students in enhancing their technical skills, building their developer profile and prepare them to get job into MNC.
 
## What it does
We Include lots of latest/Advances Hubspot features:
- On code with developers website students are able to see our upcoming courses, bootcamps and mentorship program.
- We Make a separate landing page for new students whenever any new students visit our website he can register itself on landing page and its contact get saved in database. 
- We also include one separate page for events where we list our upcoming videos/ courses and past videos where students can watch videos very easily in organised manner.
- We include Blogs page where students/ mentors and our faculty members can share their learning with students. 
- Anyone can write blogs on our page after passing through some basic criteria. and they can comment on any post ask about their queries and much more.
- We also include chatbot using this students can contact us quickly and talk to us regarding his query.
- There is one Subscription/Pricing page from that student can connect with us for some special perks like One-on-One mentorship and some special courses.
